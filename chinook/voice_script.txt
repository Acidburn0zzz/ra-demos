Part 1 - INTRO

Welcome to the RapidApp "Chinook" demo.

In this demo video we're going to build a new webapp from scratch, step by step, using RapidApp, with the "Chinook" sample database for the backend

We're going to build a Database-driven application, using the "RapidDbic" plugin, which is a component of RapidApp that provides out-of-the box front-ends for DBIx colon-colon Class, or "DBIC" for short. 

RapidDbic essentially auto-configures other RapidApp modules, which as we'll see, sets up grid and page views for DBIC Sources, proving CRUD, interactive query builders, customizable views, and so on…

For this demo, as I mentioned, we're going to use the Chinook sample database. Chinook is a freely available sample data model, with some nice sample data. It provides multiple tables with various types columns, indexes, relationships, foreign-key constraints, and so on. The purpose of Chinook is exactly for the type of demo we're doing in this video, showcasing the common use-cases for relational databases…


All steps will be performed live/real-world within this shell, which is an SSH session on an ordinary Linux box.

We will test as we go, and demonstrate the features and functionality in Firefox.

But all commands and changes will be done in this command shell and recorded with Git, and since you are already in the future, it is available on Github at the url shown…

I'm also recording the full command history - which is what is on the screen now, and is both the live commands being run, as well as serving the function of slides for this video


This video does assume the viewer has some prior knowledge. To get the most out of this video you should already know about

Perl and CPAN.

Catalyst, since RapidApp is an extension to Catalyst, which is what we'll be working in.

DBIC, and relational database concepts in general

Git, just so you can follow along in the repo and download the code we'll be building

And finally, Linux and bash just since that is the environment we're working in, within the command shell.

If you're not up to speed on all these topics, don't worry, you can still follow along and learn as you go, and there are plenty of resources available online. This video is designed to make following along as easy as possible, with every command and change recorded….



Part 2 - APP/GIT SETUP

So, first things first, we need to download and install RapidApp from CPAN. This can be done with a single command with cpan minus. As you can see, I already have RapidApp on my system, but if I didn't, it would have been automatically installed, along with all its dependencies, including Catalyst.
