 # fix multi-line cmds in history:
 # interpretation:
 #   for a line which ends with a backslash, pass unmodified until a line which doesn't.
 #   for other lines which begin with a word character,
 #     replace all occurrences of multiple spaces (followed by a non-#)
 #       with a backslash and newline and 3 spaces.
