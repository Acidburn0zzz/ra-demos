4. relative date dialog
5. row page with line chart
6. AppDV row page with html editor - insert image
7. "part template" page - drag/drop reordering
8. Organize navtree - drag/drop reordering
9. "Employee" page - example with picture, etc
10. MIME page - from MimeCas app - e-mail with rich content "Clippard product news e-mail"
